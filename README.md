# XMLtoCSV_Converter_GUI
This graphical user interface allows you to select and then convert any XML data into a CSV data. 

Inside of the comments you can find the parameters which have to be adjusted depending on the XML Format you are using. 
A basic understanding of the process of conversion can be developed by utilizing this GUI. The example.xml file can be used to test out
the GUI first.
